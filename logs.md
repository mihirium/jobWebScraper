Kinda feel like Mark Zuckerberg working on this project now. Reminds of when he made Face Mash and had to get every frats web data by using different methods because they're all different. Today was Robinhood. This shit was a pain to figure out. Turns out they get all their job content by using greenhouse api, so using requests doesn't work for this because there is no html content unless the script is called, which it never is when you first access the page. But now that I have the API links, I have all their JSON data and its very easy to parse it this way.
